                <p class="lead">Innovation and problem-solving ignite me. My daily struggle is to generate solutions to advance society in some way. Robotic automation has made this easy, but it is up to humans to make this possible and better. I want to use my technical and programming knowledge to enhance healthcare, education, entertainment, and more. I strive this through thinking of ways to solve problems, patenting them, and working on executing them, as well as my job at the Math and Computer Science Center at Emory, where I make Java programs and videos to teach struggling students math and computer science in an interactive format.</p>
                <p class="lead">In addition, I realize the value of personal relations. Hearing others’ ideas and communicating one’s own is the most important factor in not only business, but in life. I try to capture the significance of other people’s stories and the importance of personal relations through what I publish online. I love learning new languages, both foreign ones and coding ones, I sing opera, and I do a fair share of creative writing in my free time, like poetry. I always thought the same creativity and imagination that’s in writing is in computer science.</p>
